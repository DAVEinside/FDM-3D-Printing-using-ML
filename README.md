# FDM-3D-Printing-using-ML
## This is an Internship with topic: Using ML models to improve 3D printing Precision.
\
\
Using Response Surface Methodology and NN, an Genetic Algorithm based model is created for optimizing printing parameters for best possible printing precision.\
A detailed Explanination of the Job is Privided in the file below\
